# A-byte-of-Python
here are the tasks that I solve while learning the Python language by the book "A Byte of Python" 
In this repository, I keep the code that I wrote while studying the book "A byte of Python", as well as while studying "Grokking algorithms". At the moment, not all files have been fully translated into English, I'm in the process :)
Accordingly, this repository stores solutions to problems that a beginner faces when learning the Python language, as well as when learning Algorithms.
